Nucleus tools library is a set of methods/functions for platforms using Nucleus architecture. It interfaces WideBoxLib and ServiceBoxLib to communicate with Whirlpool bus protocols(WIDE and WIN). It exposes cross platform Reveal APIs and abstracts some cross platform high level tasks from APIs, e.g. settings file download. It can also be expanded to expose platform specific APIs and abstracts some platform specific high level tasks from APIs, e.g. linear pressure sensor calibration.
